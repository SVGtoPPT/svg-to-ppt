Apple Keynote and Microsoft PowerPoint don't support SVG files natively, though they have \"shapes\" that are vectors. In 2005, David Astling published a script that could convert SVG files to Keynote shapes. This application doesn't run on newer versions of macOS (likely due to being 32-bit) and is no longer supported. In 2016, Kyle Ledbetter posted this article outlining how to import SVG files into Keynote or Powerpoint by using PPT files (Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003) as a middleman.

To make the process more viable for people like me who regularly want SVG files in Keynote, I made an Alfred workflow to automate it.
