# SVG to Keynote

## About

A [scalable vector graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (SVG) is an image format that enables infinite scaling without pixelation, unlike [raster graphic formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) like JPEG and PNG.

In 2005, David Astling published a [script](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/zusman/dave/svg2key/) that could convert SVG files to Keynote shapes. This application doesn't run on newer versions of macOS (likely due to being 32-bit) and is no longer supported.

In 2016, Kyle Ledbetter posted [this article](https://kyleledbetter.medium.com/how-to-import-an-svg-into-powerpoint-or-keynote-8d3d70f347a7) outlining how to import SVG files into Keynote or Powerpoint by using [PPT files](https://www.lifewire.com/ppt-file-2622187) (Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003) as a middleman. As noted by [others](https://medium.com/@chrishoman_15983/i-often-encounter-problems-with-opening-files-created-with-openoffice-and-i-found-libreoffice-a-5a72f652160f), I found Libre Office to be more stable with less quirks.

To make the process more viable for people who regularly need SVG files in Keynote, I made this [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to automate it. It doesn't necessarily save a lot of time, but it does save human energy & sanity.

If you would like native support for SVG files and other vector formats in Keynote, I recommend [sending Apple feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html).

## Prerequisites

- [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/shop/)
  - Current prices: Â£29 for single license / Â£49 for mega supporter (free lifetime upgrades)
  - Primarily tested with `4.3.1`
- [Keynote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694)
  - Primarily tested with `10.3.9`
- [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)
  - Primarily tested with `7.0.4.2` and `7.1.0`
  - Workflow contains automated installation ðŸ™‚

## Getting Started

1. If you haven't yet, download & install Alfred with the button on [their homepage](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
2. Download the [Alfred workflow file](https://github.com/blakegearin/svg-to-keynote/raw/main/svg-to-keynote.alfredworkflow) (`svg-to-keynote.alfredworkflow`) for SVG to Keynote

## Install

1. Double-click the workflow file  to open it in Alfred, then select Import
2. Launch Alfred (default is `Cmd` + `Space`)
3. Do you have Libre Office installed?

   - **No:** Install Libre Office and the basics: `svg install complete`

   - **Yes:** Install just the application basics: `svg install basics`

## Usage

1. Launch Alfred (default is `Cmd` + `Space`)
2. Type `svg`, a space, and the name of your SVG file
3. Select your file from Alfred's search results
4. **Wait** as the workflow will start opening Libre Office and clicking buttons for you; do **NOT** click away as the workflow will get interrupted and not work
5. When Keynote opens the workflow is finished
6. Select all vectors `Ctrl` + `A`
7. Copy (`Ctrl` + `C`) and paste (`Ctrl` + `V`) shapes to other Keynote presentations

## Manual Installation/Customization

- Edit the workflow environment variables if you'd like

    | Variable Name         | Default Value                 | Description                                           |
    | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | application_directory | ~/svg-to-keynote              | Default location of output directory and template PPT |
    | output_directory      | ~/svg-to-keynote/Output       | Where the resultant PPT files are saved               |
    | template_ppt_path     | ~/svg-to-keynote/template.ppt | File path to the template PPT                         |

- DIY Libre Office installation by going to [their homepage](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/) **OR** using Homebrew

    ```bash
    # Install Homebrew if you haven't already
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    # Install Libre Office with Homebrew
    brew install libreoffice
    ```

- Retrieve the `template.ppt` from GitHub; make sure its location matches the `template_ppt_path` environment variable

    ```bash
    # Install wget if you haven't already
    brew install wget

    # Pull down template
    wget https://github.com/blakegearin/svg-to-keynote/raw/main/template.ppt
    ```

- Feel free to open `template.ppt` and edit it to your liking; it's a 4K (53.33" x 30.00") blank presentation

- The workflow uses custom hotkeys to complete most of the Libre Office steps, listed below in order of usage; you can set these manually in Libre Office (Tools > Customize > Keyboard) **OR** use the workflow `svg install hotkeys` which updates the `~/Library/Application\ Support/LibreOffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu` configuration file

  - `Ctrl` + `I` for Insert Image
  - `Ctrl` + `Z` for Align Centered (Center Horizontally)
  - `Ctrl` + `X` for Align Middle (Center Vertically)
  - `Ctrl` + `B` for Break
