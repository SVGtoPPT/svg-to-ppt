# SVG to Keynote

A [scalable vector graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (SVG) is an image format that enables infinite scaling without pixelation, unlike [raster graphic formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) like JPEG and PNG. Keynote doesn't support SVG files natively, though they have "shapes" that are vectors.

In 2005, David Astling published a [script](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/zusman/dave/svg2key/) that could convert SVG files to Keynote shapes. This application doesn't run on newer versions of macOS (likely due to being 32-bit) and is no longer supported.

In 2016, Kyle Ledbetter posted [this article](https://kyleledbetter.medium.com/how-to-import-an-svg-into-powerpoint-or-keynote-8d3d70f347a7) outlining how to import SVG files into Keynote or Powerpoint by using [PPT files](https://www.lifewire.com/ppt-file-2622187) (Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003) as a middleman. As noted by [others](https://medium.com/@chrishoman_15983/i-often-encounter-problems-with-opening-files-created-with-openoffice-and-i-found-libreoffice-a-5a72f652160f), I found Libre Office to be more stable with less quirks.

To make the process more viable for people who regularly need SVG files in Keynote, I made an [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to automate it. Then I was able to generalize it into a bash script.

If you would like native support for SVG files and other vector formats in Keynote, I recommend [sending Apple feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html).
